> üìã **Approach:** Equal Full-Stack Distribution
> 

> üë• **Team:** 2 Developers (Both learning everything)

## ü§ù Work Distribution Philosophy

### Core Principles

- **No Silos:** Both developers work on backend AND frontend every week
- **Task Rotation:** Alternate between backend/frontend tasks daily
- **Knowledge Sharing:** 15-min daily knowledge transfer
- **Pair Programming:** Complex features done together
- **Cross-Review:** Always review each other's code

### Daily Pattern

```
Monday:    Dev1: Backend API    | Dev2: iOS Feature
Tuesday:   Dev1: iOS Feature    | Dev2: Backend API
Wednesday: Dev1: Backend + iOS  | Dev2: Backend + iOS
Thursday:  Dev1: iOS Testing    | Dev2: Backend Testing
Friday:    Both: Integration, Review, Documentation
```
