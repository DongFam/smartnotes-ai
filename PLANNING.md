## 📊 Project Overview

### What We're Building

An iPad note-taking app that uses AI to beautify handwriting in real-time, with hybrid processing that keeps critical features instant (<50ms) while leveraging cloud for advanced AI.

### Why This Approach

- **Hybrid > Pure Cloud:** $73/month vs $4,000/month
- **User Experience First:** Instant feedback for writing
- **Learning Friendly:** Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Risk Mitigated:** Built-in monitoring and fallbacks from day 1

### Success Definition

- ✅ App works offline for core features
- ✅ <50ms latency for writing
- ✅ Costs scale linearly with users
- ✅ Both developers can maintain any part
- ✅ 4.5+ App Store rating
